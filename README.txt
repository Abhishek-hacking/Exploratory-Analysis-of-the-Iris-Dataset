Exploratory Analysis of the Iris Dataset

Project Overview
----------------
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the classic Iris dataset using R. 
The Iris dataset, a well-known dataset for classification and pattern recognition tasks, 
contains 150 samples of iris flowers with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal 
length, and petal width, along with their species labels. This analysis aims to uncover 
key patterns, relationships, and potential outliers in the data, providing insights useful 
for further preprocessing and model development.

Dataset
-------
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)  
- Features:  
  - Sepal.Length: Sepal length in cm  
  - Sepal.Width: Sepal width in cm  
  - Petal.Length: Petal length in cm  
  - Petal.Width: Petal width in cm  
  - Species: Species of the flower (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

Project Structure
-----------------
README.txt               # Project overview
iris_eda.R               # R script for EDA
iris_plots               # Folder containing plots generated in the analysis

Analysis Steps
--------------
1. Data Loading: Loading the Iris dataset in R.
2. Data Inspection: Checking the dataset structure, summary statistics, and identifying any missing values.
3. Distribution Analysis: Exploring the distribution of each feature using histograms and boxplots.
4. Outlier Detection: Identifying potential outliers using boxplots and z-scores.
5. Relationships Between Variables: Visualizing pairwise relationships with scatter plots and pair plots.

Key Insights
------------
- Distribution Patterns: Visualizations show differences in distribution patterns across the three species.
- Relationships: Scatter plots highlight potential correlations between features such as petal length and petal width.
- Outliers: A few outliers were identified in Sepal Width for some species, which could affect modeling outcomes.

How to Run the Analysis
-----------------------
1. Prerequisites: Ensure you have R installed along with the required packages:
   install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr"))

2. Run the Script: Execute iris_eda.R in RStudio or an R console to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

Results and Visualizations
--------------------------
The iris_plots folder contains generated plots, illustrating key relationships and distributions in the Iris dataset.
